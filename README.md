## Description

The SJDA Alphabet Test is used to collect a student's knowledge of the alphabet and record it in a database. The creators of this project were inspired by one of the team member's experiences as a literacy tutor at an Elementary school. He noticed the excessive man hours spent on 1-on-1 testing of children's alphebet knowledge  by teachers and literacy interventionists. Many of these children,  ages 5-7, did not remember several letters of the alphabet. It was urgent to automate the collection of this data to make the job of teachers and literacy interventionists much easier. 

This full-stack web application is created using a variety of technologies.
